About the fork
--------------

This project is a fork of apparently dead "django-pagination" project
originally written by 'Eric Florenzano'. It is maintained by the @alternativshik.
Latest releases can be found on pypi.


About top-level package name change
-----------------------------------
The top level package name was changed from `pagination` to
`alter-django-pagination`. I did this to ensure that existing users of the
original package could easily transition, on their own terms. Since both
packages are co-installable you are free to check things out and see if the new
pagination code works well for you or not.

Also, since the implementation of the actual tags was rewritten I would not
feel entirely confident that the new package is a drop-in replacement.
